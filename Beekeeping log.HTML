            Welcome, welcome to the log of bees!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Come with me to enter the realm of the bee lifestyle and dive into the honey-tastic adventures and journeys bees travel. The are three roles that a honey bee is genetically assigned. Those are the drone, queen and worker bees.These roles have an essential benefit to the animal kingdom. Providing food to humans all over the globe.
        </p>
<h2>
    What are worker, queen and drone bees?
</h2>
<p>
    A worker bee is a standerised bee with gathers pollen, produces honey and nurse the larvae to become one of these three roles</p>

    <p>The queen is the bee which takes care of the reproduction by having drones impregnate them, making 5-6 eggs every minute. </p>

    <p>
        The drone is used for fertilising the eggs in the queen, so then new larvae can be taken care of and can become the new generation of Bees.
